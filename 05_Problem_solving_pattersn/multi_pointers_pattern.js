//Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers.  the function shoudl find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

function sumZero(arr){
    return
}

const arr1 = [-3, -3, -2, -1, 0] //=> [-3, -3]
const arr2 = [3,2,-2,-3] // => [2, -2]
const arr3 = [2, 3, 5, -4] // => undefined
